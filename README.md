Hello, my name is Victor Possani, i'm a brasilian economics student at University of São Paulo (Usp).
I created this github profile to be my repository of economics projects and simulations of theorical models. 

I am very excited to learn more about implementations of macroeconomics and microeconomics fields in programing languages.
